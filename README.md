## 🔧 Development

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Shared Logic** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Create in shared/ directory
   shared/redux/slices/myFeatureSlice.ts
   shared/services/myFeatureApi.ts
   ```

2. **Mobile UI**:
   ```bash
   # Create in mobile app
   constrogen_mobile/app/(app)/my-feature/
   ```

3. **Web UI**:
   ```bash
   # Create in web app
   constrogen_web/src/pages/MyFeature.tsx
   ```

### Running Both Apps

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Mobile
cd constrogen_mobile && npm start

# Terminal 2 - Web
cd constrogen_web && npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Mobile

```bash
cd constrogen_mobile
npm test                    # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e           # E2E tests
```

### Web

```bash
cd constrogen_web
npm test                    # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e           # E2E tests (if configured)
```

### Shared Logic

```bash
cd shared
npm test                    # Test shared code
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Mobile

```bash
cd constrogen_mobile
# Build with EAS
eas build --platform ios
eas build --platform android
# Submit to stores
eas submit
```

### Web

```bash
cd constrogen_web
# Build for production
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel (recommended)
vercel
# Or deploy dist/ folder to any static host
```

## 📊 Browser Support

| Browser | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Chrome | 90+ | ✅ Fully supported |
| Firefox | 88+ | ✅ Fully supported |
| Safari | 14+ | ✅ Fully supported |
| Edge | 90+ | ✅ Fully supported |
| Opera | 76+ | ✅ Fully supported |
| Samsung Internet | 14+ | ✅ Fully supported |

## 🔐 Security

- **Mobile**: Tokens stored in SecureStore (encrypted)
- **Web**: Tokens stored in localStorage with short expiration
- **Both**: HTTPS required, JWT authentication, automatic logout on token expiry

## 📈 Performance

### Mobile

- Bundle size: ~15MB (optimized)
- Cold start: < 2 seconds
- Hot reload: Instant

### Web

- Bundle size: ~160KB (gzipped)
- First load: < 3 seconds (3G)
- Lighthouse score: 90+ (target)

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Read the architecture documentation
2. Follow the coding standards
3. Keep shared code platform-agnostic
4. Test on both platforms
5. Document platform-specific code

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Assets not loading (Web)

```bash
# Copy assets from mobile to web
bash copy-assets.sh  # Unix/Mac
copy-assets.bat      # Windows
```

### TypeScript errors in shared/

```bash
# Make sure tsconfig.json includes shared directory
# Check that paths are correctly mapped
```

### Service Worker issues (Web)

```bash
# Clear service worker cache
# Chrome DevTools > Application > Service Workers > Unregister
# Then hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
```

### CORS errors (Web)

```bash
# Backend must allow requests from your web domain
# Contact backend team to add your domain to CORS whitelist
```
